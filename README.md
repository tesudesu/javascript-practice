I learnt JavaScript using freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures and earned the certification by completing the following 5 projects.

**Palindrome Checker:** 
Return true if the given string is a palindrome, excluding all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and letter case. Otherwise, return false.

**Roman Numeral Converter:** 
Convert the given number into a roman numeral.

**Caesars Cipher:** 
Write a function that shifts all letters by 13 places, leaving non-alphabetic characters as they are.

**Telephone Number Validator:** 
Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number. The area code is required. The area code may be surrounded by parentheses. The country code of 1 is optional. Dashes are optional. Otherwise, return false.

**Cash Register:** 
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument. Outputs different things depending on whether there is enough funds in the drawer for the change or whether exact change can be given.

An example of a cid array:
```
[
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
]
```
